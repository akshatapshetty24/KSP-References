       System  load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or un‐
       interruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either using the CPU or waiting to use
       the  CPU.   A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for
       disk.


📖 What is Load Average?
The load average is a measure of system activity, 
showing the average number of processes that are either running or waiting for CPU or I/O over a period of time.

load average: 1.23, 0.85, 0.65
These correspond to:
1.23 → average over the last 1 minute
0.85 → average over the last 5 minutes
0.65 → average over the last 15 minutes

📖 How to Check Load Average:
uptime
top
cat /proc/loadavg

📌 Load Average Includes:
✅ Processes running on CPU
✅ Processes waiting for CPU
✅ Processes in uninterruptible sleep (like waiting for disk I/O)
It does not count sleeping or idle processes.

📌 Rule of Thumb:
Load Average vs CPU Cores	System Health
Load <= Number of CPU Cores	Healthy
Load > Number of CPU Cores	Overloaded
