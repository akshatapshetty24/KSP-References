✅ Complete Boot Sequence Flow:

1️⃣ POST (Power-On Self Test)

Performed by BIOS/UEFI — checks hardware (RAM, disks, CPU)

2️⃣ MBR/Bootloader stage

BIOS reads MBR (first 512 bytes on boot disk)

Loads bootloader like GRUB

3️⃣ GRUB Stage

Displays boot menu

Loads kernel and initrd/initramfs (temporary root FS image)

4️⃣ Kernel Initialization

Initializes hardware drivers

Mounts root filesystem from disk

Starts init system

5️⃣ init/Systemd Process

PID 1 — executes system initialization

Reads /etc/inittab (SysV) or systemd unit files (RHEL7/8/9)

6️⃣ Runlevel / Target Load

Starts services, daemons, mounts file systems

7️⃣ Login Prompt

getty spawns TTY or graphical login manager appears

✅ You can remember it like:
POST → MBR → GRUB → Kernel → initramfs → init/systemd → Targets/Runlevels → Login



📖 Linux Boot Sequence Flow
1️⃣ POST (Power-On Self Test)
BIOS/UEFI performs hardware checks:

RAM

Disk drives

CPU

Keyboard, etc.

2️⃣ MBR / Bootloader Stage
BIOS/UEFI reads MBR (first 512 bytes of boot disk)

MBR contains the bootloader (like GRUB)

3️⃣ GRUB Stage
Displays boot menu

Loads Kernel and initramfs (Initial RAM Filesystem)

Passes control to the kernel

4️⃣ Kernel Initialization
Kernel initializes:

CPU

Memory management

Device drivers

Mounts initramfs as a temporary root filesystem

Prepares the environment for init or systemd

5️⃣ Initramfs / Init System Startup
initramfs runs initial scripts for:

Loading essential drivers

Setting up the real root filesystem

Executes init (SysV) or systemd (PID 1) as the first user-space process

6️⃣ System Initialization (Systemd)
Initializes system targets:

Mounts file systems

Starts essential services and daemons

Configures networking

Targets replace traditional runlevels

7️⃣ Runlevel / Target Load
Systemd Targets (like multi-user.target, graphical.target) define what services to start

Brings system to desired operational state

8️⃣ User Login
Launches getty on TTYs

Displays login prompt (or GUI via display manager)

User logs in and gains shell or desktop environment access

📌 1️⃣ POST (Power-On Self Test)
When the system powers on, BIOS/UEFI runs POST to check hardware health (RAM, CPU, disk, keyboard).

If POST passes, it looks for a bootable disk.

📌 2️⃣ MBR (Master Boot Record)
The BIOS reads the first 512 bytes of the bootable disk (MBR).

MBR contains:

Boot loader information (like GRUB Stage 1)

Partition table

It transfers control to the boot loader.

📌 3️⃣ GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)
GRUB is the boot loader which loads the kernel into memory.

Shows a boot menu (if configured).

Loads kernel and initramfs (Initial RAM filesystem) into memory.

Passes boot parameters to the kernel.

📌 4️⃣ Kernel
The kernel is the core of the OS.

Initializes hardware drivers, memory management, CPU scheduling.

Mounts initramfs as temporary root filesystem.

Executes the first process (PID 1) — either init (SysVinit) or systemd on modern systems.

📌 5️⃣ Initramfs
Temporary root filesystem loaded into memory by GRUB.

Contains essential drivers (disk, filesystem, etc.).

Helps the kernel mount the actual root filesystem (/).

Once actual root is mounted, initramfs is unmounted.

📌 6️⃣ Init/Systemd
PID 1 process.

Initializes system services.

In older systems: /etc/inittab defines the default runlevel.

In modern systems: systemd uses targets like multi-user.target, graphical.target.

📌 7️⃣ Targets/Runlevels
A target/runlevel defines what services and environment get loaded.

Examples:

multi-user.target (like Runlevel 3 — CLI)

graphical.target (like Runlevel 5 — GUI)

systemd uses .target files under /etc/systemd/system/

📌 8️⃣ Login
Once all services are up, login prompts appear.

Can be TTY for CLI or Display Manager for GUI.

User logs in, and a shell session or GUI session begins.
