In traditional BIOS + MBR boot process (like in GRUB legacy), the bootloader is split into stages because of size limitations in the MBR (only 512 bytes). Here’s how it works:

📖 Boot Process Stages
📌 Stage 1
Located in the MBR (Master Boot Record) — first 512 bytes of the boot disk.

Its job is very simple:
👉 Load Stage 1.5 or Stage 2 loader from a known location on disk.

Why? Because 512 bytes isn’t enough for full filesystem drivers or config parsing.

It only knows where to find the next stage (usually in the boot sector of a dedicated /boot partition)

📌 Stage 1.5 (Optional in GRUB legacy)
Resides in the space between the MBR and first partition (usually 31 KB free space)

Adds support for basic filesystem reading (like ext3/ext4)

Its job: Load Stage 2 from the /boot/grub directory

📌 Stage 2
This is the main GRUB program

Located typically in /boot/grub

Its responsibilities:

Display GRUB menu

Let user select a kernel

Load the selected Kernel and initramfs

Pass kernel parameters (like root partition)

Hand over control to the Linux Kernel

📌 Summary:
Stage	Location	Role
Stage 1	MBR (512 bytes)	Load Stage 1.5/Stage 2
Stage 1.5	Between MBR & partition	Add filesystem support (optional in GRUB2)
Stage 2	/boot/grub	Show boot menu, load kernel & initramfs

Note:

In GRUB2 (RHEL 7/8/9), this concept is modernized — most of it’s combined into core.img which acts like Stage 1.5 & 2, loaded by MBR or BIOS.

Would you like me to chart out GRUB2 boot flow as well? 👌

Awesome — let’s nail down a clean and clear explanation of the GRUB2 boot process 🚀

📖 GRUB2 Boot Process Flow (RHEL 7/8/9)
Unlike legacy GRUB, GRUB2 has a slightly different and cleaner structure — but still works in logical stages:

📌 1️⃣ BIOS/UEFI Initialization
Performs POST

Locates the boot disk based on boot order

📌 2️⃣ Load MBR (BIOS systems) or EFI Bootloader (UEFI systems)
MBR (first 512 bytes) contains a tiny bootloader stub

Loads the next part: GRUB2’s core image (core.img)

On UEFI, system directly loads grubx64.efi from EFI System Partition (ESP)

📌 3️⃣ core.img
Located either immediately after MBR (on BIOS systems) or inside the EFI partition (on UEFI)

Contains:

Basic filesystem drivers (to read /boot)

Path to grub.cfg configuration file

Loads grub.cfg

📌 4️⃣ grub.cfg
Located in /boot/grub2/ (BIOS) or /boot/efi/EFI/<distro>/ (UEFI)

Defines:

Boot menu entries

Default kernel selection

Timeout

Kernel and initramfs paths

Kernel parameters (like root= device)

📌 5️⃣ Kernel + initramfs Load
GRUB2 loads:

The selected Linux kernel (vmlinuz-xxx)

The corresponding initramfs (initramfs-xxx.img)

📌 6️⃣ Kernel Initialization
Kernel decompresses and mounts initramfs

Loads drivers/modules needed for real root filesystem

Mounts real root filesystem

📌 7️⃣ Start systemd
Kernel executes /sbin/init (or /usr/lib/systemd/systemd) — PID 1

Starts all services and brings system to target

📊 GRUB2 Boot Process Summary Table
Stage	BIOS Flow	UEFI Flow
POST	BIOS POST	UEFI POST
Bootloader Stub	Load MBR → core.img	Load grubx64.efi from ESP
core.img	From reserved disk sectors	Embedded in EFI partition
grub.cfg	Read /boot/grub2/grub.cfg	Read from EFI partition or /boot
Kernel + initramfs	Load selected kernel/initramfs	Load selected kernel/initramfs
Kernel boot	Kernel mounts initramfs	Kernel mounts initramfs
systemd (PID 1)	Starts system services	Starts system services
